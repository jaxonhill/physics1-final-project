## Final Project - 2D Kinematics by Jaxon Hill

This is my Final Project for my Physics 1 class, where I discuss 2D Kinematics on an interactive web page to help explain different aspects of this topic. You can discover how time, displacement, velocity, and acceleration all are connected through interactive sliders; as well as how components of a velocity vector would be affected as you change the angle theta. Finally, I explained projectile and rotational motion and then solved an original problem relating to projectile motion where I lay out my steps on how to solve it.

I wrote this paper almost as if it were an introduction / guide as well as an overview, as it is something I wish I could have utilized to help grasp these topics when I first learned them. I hope you think it's cool, as I had a lot of fun building it!

For other programmers who are interested, the project is built with TypeScript, Tailwind, and Next.js.
